Part 2 was not clear so I visited /r/adventofcode for some
[help](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/a87j9k/2018_day_21_part_2_how_can_my_answer_be_too_low/).

There I [found a comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/a87j9k/2018_day_21_part_2_how_can_my_answer_be_too_low/ec8jtjc/)
that helped me to understand what Part 2 was asking:

```
Whats really going on is that the number sequence will begin to repeat (== run infinitely).
They want the last number before it loops. This has nothing to do with being a 'lowest number'.

Took me a while to figure that out too.
```
