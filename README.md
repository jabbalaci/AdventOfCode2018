Advent of Code 2018
===================

Last year I solved [AoC 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017) in Python.
This year I plan to solve [AoC 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018/) in Nim.

If I get stuck, I might change to Python :), but the goal is to solve the exercises
in Nim, that I started to learn at the end of September, 2018.
