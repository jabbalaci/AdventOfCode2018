Notes
=====

This file contains my original idea to select the best starting point.
It's slow, it ran on my desktop for about 1.5 hours. I realized that
it's enough to work with the coordinates of the nanobots and select
the best candidate from them.

However, I leave it here for reference. This program actually gives a
better candidate but it runs slower.
